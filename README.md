This is the code for my portfolio website. As part of trying to learn web / full stack development, I decided to start with learning the front end side of development first, as I figured that it would be a little easier to learn, and also because it wouldn't have a portfolio to show off to potential employers, especially one that I can say that I built myself. With that in mind, know that I don't really have much front end development experience, so if you decide to take a look around my code, you may see some stuff that is definitely not right, or at least a little weird. You may even see that by just simply looking at the site. In that regard, feel free to send me an email / message on what you think I could do to improve the site.

Anyways, here is what I used to create the site:
- Figma (for designing the site);
- VS Code (IDE for programming the site);
- Vite (for creating the initial build and automatically applying changes);
- Node (for using npm);
- npm (for downloading and installing other tools);
- Git (for local version control);
- GitHub (for online storage and online version control);
- GitHub Pages (for hosting the website);
- React (for creating the site);
- React Router;
- Yet Another React Lightbox;
- HTML / CSS / JSX;
- TypeScript / JavaScript;
